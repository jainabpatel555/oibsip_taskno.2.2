                Lamarr began her acting career in Europe, gaining fame for her role in the controversial film "Ecstasy" (1933). 
                In 1937, she moved to Hollywood, where she starred in numerous successful films, including "Algiers" (1938) and 
                "Boom Town" (1940).

                Lamarr starred in numerous successful films, captivating audiences with her beauty and talent.
                In addition to her acting career, she co-invented an early version of frequency-hopping spread spectrum communication,
                a technology now essential for wireless communication.

                Beyond her acting prowess, Hedy Lamarr possessed a brilliant mind. During World War II, she co-invented, 
                alongside composer George Antheil, a frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology aimed at improving torpedo guidance. 
                Although the invention was not immediately recognized, it laid the foundation for modern wireless communication and is a 
                precursor to technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
